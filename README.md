## Installation

```javascript
tns plugin add nativescript-picker
```

## Configuration
No additional configuration required!

## Usage
To use the `PickerField` in markup you need to:
 - If you are developing a NativeScript Core app, you need to register the plugin namespace in the xml:
 ```xml
 <Page
    xmlns="http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd"
    xmlns:picker="nativescript-picker">
    <picker:PickerField hint="Click here" items="{{ pickerItems }}"/>
...
 ```
 - If you are developing a NativeScript Angular app, you need to import the plugin module in the module of your component: 
```ts
import { NativeScriptPickerModule } from "nativescript-picker/angular";
...
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        NativeScriptPickerModule,
        ...
    ],
    ...
 ```
 Then you will be able to declare the fields in the html of your component:
```html
<PickerField hint="Click here" [items]="pickerItems"></PickerField>
```
 - If you are developing a NativeScript Vue app, you need to install the plugin in you app.js file:
 ```js
import Vue from "nativescript-vue";
import { PickerField } from 'nativescript-picker/vue';

Vue.use(PickerField);
 ```
Then you will be able to declare the fields in the template of your component:
```html
<PickerField hint="Click here"></PickerField>
```

## Features

### PickerField

The `PickerField` is a NativeScript `TextField` which means that any functionality the default `TextField` provides is also available in the `PickerField` component. The only difference is that by design it is in "read-only" mode, or simply put you cannot change its text by input or select that text. Changing the text of the `PickerField` is done by its main functionality which is opening a modal popup that shows a list of objects from which you can select one by tapping it.

## API

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pickerTitle` | The title of the modal view. |
| `items` | The source collection used to populate the list of the modal view. |
| `itemTemplate` | Ð¢he UI template for list view items of the list of the modal view. |
| `modalAnimated` | Optional parameter specifying whether to show the modal view with animation. |
| `textField` | The 'property' of the object from the 'items' collection that will be used by the 'text' property of the PickerField. |
| `valueField` | The 'property' of the object from the 'items' collection that will be used by when setting the 'selectedValue' property of the PickerField. |
| `selectedValue` | The object selected from the list in the modal view. |
| `selectedIndex` | The index of the object from the 'items' collection that has been selected from the list in the modal view. |
| `iOSCloseButtonPosition` | The position of the 'close' button of the ActionBar of the modal view. |

## Styling

### PickerField
The `PickerField` can be targeted in CSS through its element selector and additionally by setting a class. The `PickerField` also opens a modal window containing a Page element that contains an ActionBar and a ListView. This Page element can be targeted with the `PickerPage` selector and through it style all picker modals with selectors like `PickerPage ActionBar` and `PickerPage ListView`. In addition to that, if you set a class on the PickerField, it will be transferred on the `PickerPage` and with it you can style individual modals.
